Above you see the main menu of the program.

# Temperature

This section shows you all the results you get from the program. If you press the "Goal" button, you will see the goals as a bar diagram, and if you press the "Card" button, you will see the cards as a line diagram.

# Referee

This section shows you results of a specific referee. You have to enter exactly same string to entry. If you press the "Goal" button, you will see the goals as a bar diagram, and if you press the "Card" button, you will see the cards as a line diagram.

# Home
![home](https://github.com/sehaaz/Temperature-Of-PLeague/assets/97370691/721cf68c-7cc1-418b-8c9e-778cb751e69e)

This section shows you results of a specific home team. You have to enter exactly same string to entry. If you press the "Goal" button, you will see the goals as a bar diagram, and if you press the "Card" button, you will see the cards as a line diagram.

# Away
 ![away](https://github.com/sehaaz/Temperature-Of-PLeague/assets/97370691/c5315648-9f1f-4356-96da-8600f7f40980)

This section shows you results of a specific away team. You have to enter exactly same string to entry. If you press the "Goal" button, you will see the goals as a bar diagram, and if you press the "Card" button, you will see the cards as a line diagram.

# Simulation
![simulation](https://github.com/sehaaz/Temperature-Of-PLeague/assets/97370691/f1070e44-5d31-4bfb-8f2e-ca4c5598a39d)

In this section, you perform a simulation based on the results obtained. You must enter the home team, away team, temperature and referee entry respectively. You must enter exactly the same string for input. As a result, you will get the home team goal, the away team goal, the number of yellow cards and the number of red cards.

•	These results are obtained by collecting the required data at the entered temperature value and dividing it by 3.

# Get Data
![get data](https://github.com/sehaaz/Temperature-Of-PLeague/assets/97370691/ccb3e36b-3bb0-48bf-b3bd-4b40c7a83890)

In this section, you select the range of information you want to evaluate. The program can only take between the "2000-2001" and "2018-2019" seasons.

•	When specifying the season you want, you should write only the last two digits. For example, when you want to get the information between the "2003-2004" season and the "2011-2012" season, you should write 3 in the "Start" section and 11 in the "End" section. 

•	Min. Start = 0, Max End = 18.
